# Unit Test Results Table

## Test Results for getNextId() Method

| Test ID | Description | Expected Value | Actual Value | Result | Developer |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| UT_GETNEXTID_001_TC1 | Unit test that verifies getNextId() returns 1 when the questions list is empty. The method should find the maximum ID (which is 0 for an empty list) and return max + 1 = 1. | 1 | [Fill after running test] | [pass/fail] | [Your Name] |

## Instructions:
1. Run the `testGetNextId_EmptyList()` test method in Eclipse (Right-click the method → Run As → JUnit Test)
2. Check the JUnit view for the test result
3. Fill in the "Actual Value" column with the actual return value (should be 1)
4. Fill in the "Result" column with "pass" if the test passed, "fail" if it failed
5. Replace "[Your Name]" with your actual name

## Note:
This table documents one representative test case from the getNextId() unit tests. The full test suite contains 7 test methods covering various scenarios (empty list, sequential IDs, non-sequential IDs, single question, large IDs, unordered IDs).
